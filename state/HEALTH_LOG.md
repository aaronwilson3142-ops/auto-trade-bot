## Health Check — 2026-04-28 19:55 UTC (Tuesday 2:55 PM CT, market closed)

**Overall Status:** YELLOW — Stack recovered from path migration; 4-day data gap + position cap breach on restart burst.

### §1 Infrastructure
- Containers: 7/7 healthy + k8s control plane. Worker/API recreated ~30min ago (path migration fix). Grafana/Prometheus/Alertmanager/Redis up 11 days. No restart loops.
- /health: all components `ok` (db, broker, scheduler, paper_cycle, broker_auth, system_state_pollution, kill_switch). Mode=paper.
- Worker/API log scan: CLEAN — zero ERROR/CRITICAL/Traceback in 24h window. No crash-triad regression patterns.
- Prometheus: 2/2 targets up (apis, prometheus), 0 dropped.
- Alertmanager: 0 firing alerts.
- Resource usage: all normal. Highest mem: k8s control plane 2.52GiB (8%). Worker 134MiB, API 174MiB, Postgres 78MiB. No CPU spikes.
- DB size: 138 MB.

### §2 Execution + Data Audit
- Paper cycles last 30h: 0 completed. Last run: 2026-04-24 21:00 UTC (4 days ago). 2 weekdays missed (Fri Apr 25, Mon Apr 27) due to Docker mount failure from path migration on Apr 27.
- Portfolio trend: latest snapshot 2026-04-28 19:30 UTC — cash=$10,263.80, equity=$99,955.74. Cash positive. Prior snapshot (same timestamp): cash=$94,121.31, equity=$105,874.04. Delta reflects 7 new positions opened in restart burst.
- Broker<->DB reconciliation: broker endpoint 404 (expected per build). /health broker=ok. 8 open positions in DB.
- Origin-strategy stamping: ALL 8 open positions have origin_strategy set (7x ranking_buy_signal, 1x momentum_v1). No NULLs. ✅
- **Position cap breach: 7 new positions opened today vs MAX_NEW_POSITIONS_PER_DAY=5.** All 7 opened simultaneously at 19:30 UTC during restart burst. Total open=8 vs MAX_POSITIONS=15 (within cap).
- Data freshness: prices=2026-04-23 (5 days stale), signals=2026-04-24, rankings=2026-04-24. 490 securities covered in daily bars.
- Stale tickers: no NEW additions beyond known 13.
- Kill-switch: false. Operating mode: paper. ✅
- Evaluation history rows: 91 (above 80 floor). ✅
- Idempotency: clean — 0 duplicate orders, 0 duplicate open positions. ✅

### §3 Code + Schema
- Alembic head: `p6q7r8s9t0u1` (single head). No drift. ✅
- Pytest smoke: BLOCKED by Phase 68 test DB guard — conftest refuses to run against production DB (expected behavior, not a regression). Cannot verify 358/360 baseline this run.
- Git: 0 unpushed commits. Dirty tree: 7 modified files (state docs + bat scripts), 1 untracked (`apis/infra/docker/rebuild.bat`). Non-critical.
- **GitHub Actions CI:** Run #29 `7100312` conclusion=success, completed 2026-04-28 00:09 UTC. GREEN. https://github.com/aaronwilson3142-ops/auto-trade-bot/actions/runs/25026048474

### §4 Config + Gate Verification
- All critical APIS_* flags at expected values:
  - APIS_OPERATING_MODE=paper ✅
  - APIS_KILL_SWITCH=false ✅
  - APIS_MAX_POSITIONS=15 ✅
  - APIS_MAX_NEW_POSITIONS_PER_DAY=5 ✅
  - APIS_MAX_THEMATIC_PCT=0.75 ✅
  - APIS_RANKING_MIN_COMPOSITE_SCORE=0.30 ✅
  - APIS_SELF_IMPROVEMENT_AUTO_EXECUTE_ENABLED not set (defaults false) ✅
  - APIS_INSIDER_FLOW_PROVIDER not set (defaults null) ✅
  - Deep-Dive Step 6/7/8 flags not set (defaults OFF) ✅
- Scheduler: job_count=35 (expected per DEC-021). ✅

### Issues Found
- **4-day execution gap** (Apr 25–28): No paper cycles ran from Apr 25 through Apr 28 19:25 UTC. Root cause: project path migration on Apr 27 broke Docker bind mounts; containers needed `docker compose up -d` (not just `docker restart`). Worker/API only recreated ~30min ago.
- **Position cap breach**: 7 new positions opened in a single restart-burst cycle at 19:30 UTC, exceeding MAX_NEW_POSITIONS_PER_DAY=5. The per-day cap is not enforced during first-cycle-after-restart when the position count starts from near-zero open positions.
- **Data freshness**: Daily market bars stale since Apr 23 (5 days). Signals and rankings stale since Apr 24. Ingestion jobs likely failed during the mount-broken window and haven't re-run yet (next ingestion: 06:00 ET tomorrow).
- **Pytest smoke unreachable**: Phase 68 test DB guard blocks pytest inside docker-api-1 against the production DB. Need a test-database sidecar or env override to restore smoke testing in health checks.

### Fixes Applied
- None this run. Stack was already recovered (containers recreated before this health check ran).

### Action Required from Aaron
- **Review position cap breach**: 7 positions opened in restart burst exceeds the 5/day cap. Consider adding a startup-aware throttle that respects MAX_NEW_POSITIONS_PER_DAY even on first cycle after restart.
- **Monitor data freshness**: Ingestion/signal/ranking jobs should auto-recover starting tomorrow 06:00 ET. If prices still stale by Wed Apr 29 10:00 ET, investigate scheduler.
- **Pytest smoke in health checks**: Phase 68 guard correctly blocks tests against prod DB. Consider creating a test DB config or `--override-db-check` flag for health-check pytest runs.


## Health Check — 2026-04-29 13:10 UTC (Tuesday 8:10 AM CT, market pre-open)

**Overall Status:** GREEN — Stack fully operational, data freshness recovered, clean $100k baseline restored, all flags correct, CI green.

- Prometheus: 2/2 up. Alertmanager: 0 firing. Resources: all normal. DB: 150 MB.

### §2 Execution + Data Audit
- Paper cycles last 30h: 1 paper + 1 research complete. Today's first cycle at 09:35 ET not yet due.
- Portfolio: $100,000 cash / $100,000 equity. Clean baseline restored.
- 0 open positions. Broker<->DB consistent. Idempotency clean.
- Data freshness: prices=Apr 28, rankings=Apr 29, signals=Apr 29. Fully recovered.
- Kill-switch: false. Eval history: 93.

### §4 Config
- All APIS_* flags at expected values. Scheduler: 35 jobs. ✅

### Issues Found
- None.

### Fixes Applied
- None needed.

### Action Required from Aaron
- Enable `APIS_PYTEST_SMOKE=1` to restore health-check smoke testing (low priority).
- Address API restore warnings for regime/readiness ORM drift (low priority).

## Health Check — 2026-04-29 16:15 UTC (Tuesday 11:15 AM CT, market open)

**Overall Status:** YELLOW — Position cap breach (27 vs 5) under Phase 69 code today; Phase 70 deployed at 16:04 UTC to fix. Phase 70 source changes uncommitted (12 dirty files). Pytest smoke unreachable.

### §1 Infrastructure
- Containers: 7/7 APIS healthy + k8s control plane. Worker up 15min (restarted 16:00 UTC for Phase 70 deploy). API up 16min. Postgres up 21h. Monitoring (Grafana/Prometheus/Alertmanager/Redis) up 12 days. No restart loops.

- API log scan: 2 pre-existing restore warnings (regime_result_restore_failed: detection_basis_json; readiness_report_restore_failed: ReadinessGateRow missing 'description'). Known stale tickers. No crash-triad patterns.
- Prometheus: 2/2 targets up (apis, prometheus), 0 dropped.
- Alertmanager: 0 firing alerts.
- Resource usage: all normal. Worker 71 MiB, API 168 MiB, Postgres 140 MiB, k8s 2.4 GiB (7.7%). No CPU/mem spikes.

### §2 Execution + Data Audit
- Paper cycles last 30h: 2 completed yesterday (1 paper 21:00 UTC, 1 research 20:45 UTC). Today 2 cycles ran under previous worker (13:35 + 14:30 UTC). No cycles yet under Phase 70 worker (started 16:00 UTC). Next cycle at 16:35 UTC (12:35 ET).
- Portfolio trend: latest snapshot 2026-04-29 16:04 UTC — cash=,000, equity=,000 (Phase 70 clean baseline). **Note: 13 open positions with ~ cost basis not yet reflected in snapshot — will reconcile on next cycle.**
- Broker<->DB reconciliation: broker endpoint 404 (expected per build). /health broker=ok. 13 open positions in DB.
- Origin-strategy stamping: ALL 13 open positions have origin_strategy set (12x rebalance, 1x ranking_buy_signal). No NULLs. ✅
- **Position cap breach: 27 new positions today (6 at 13:35, 21 at 14:30 UTC) vs MAX_NEW_POSITIONS_PER_DAY=5.** Total open=13 vs MAX_POSITIONS=15 (within absolute cap). Occurred under Phase 69 code; Phase 70 deployed at 16:04 UTC with strengthened daily cap enforcement.
- Data freshness: prices=2026-04-28 (yesterday, current). Rankings=2026-04-29 10:45 UTC (today). Signals=2026-04-29 10:30 UTC (5 types × 2012 rows, today). Fully current.
- Stale tickers: known 13 only, no new additions.
- Kill-switch: false. Operating mode: paper. ✅
- Evaluation history rows: 93 (above 80 floor). ✅
- Idempotency: clean — 0 duplicate orders, 0 duplicate open-position tickers. ✅

### §3 Code + Schema
- Alembic head: `p6q7r8s9t0u1` (single head). No drift. ✅
- Pytest smoke: BLOCKED — test files not found at expected path inside docker-api-1 container. Phase 68 guard + container rebuild may have excluded test directory. Cannot verify baseline this run.
- Git: **12 modified + 1 untracked**. Phase 70 source code changes (paper_trading.py, adapter.py, api/main.py, worker/main.py) + state docs NOT committed. 0 unpushed commits to origin.
- **GitHub Actions CI:** Run #30 `7e87714` conclusion=success, completed 2026-04-28 20:46 UTC. GREEN. https://github.com/aaronwilson3142-ops/auto-trade-bot/actions/runs/25076307630

### §4 Config + Gate Verification
- All critical APIS_* flags at expected values:
  - APIS_OPERATING_MODE=paper ✅
  - APIS_KILL_SWITCH=false ✅
  - APIS_MAX_POSITIONS=15 ✅
  - APIS_MAX_NEW_POSITIONS_PER_DAY=5 ✅
  - APIS_MAX_THEMATIC_PCT=0.75 ✅
  - APIS_RANKING_MIN_COMPOSITE_SCORE=0.30 ✅
  - APIS_SELF_IMPROVEMENT_AUTO_EXECUTE_ENABLED not set (defaults false) ✅
  - APIS_INSIDER_FLOW_PROVIDER not set (defaults null) ✅
  - Deep-Dive Step 6/7/8 flags not set (defaults OFF) ✅
- Scheduler: job_count=35 (expected per DEC-021). Worker started 2026-04-29 16:00 UTC. ✅

### Issues Found
- **Position cap breach (27 vs 5)**: Phase 69's daily_opens_count fix was insufficient — 27 positions opened today across 2 cycles (6 at 13:35 + 21 at 14:30) vs MAX_NEW_POSITIONS_PER_DAY=5. Phase 70 deployed at 16:04 UTC to address this with strengthened enforcement. Validation needed on next cycle (~16:35 UTC).
- **Phase 70 code uncommitted**: 12 modified files including 4 core source files (paper_trading.py, adapter.py, api/main.py, worker/main.py) are deployed to containers via bind mount but NOT committed to git. CI cannot validate these changes.
- **Snapshot/position inconsistency**: Latest snapshot shows  cash but 13 positions are open with ~ cost basis. Phase 70 cleanup snapshot was written before broker loaded positions. Will self-correct on next cycle.
- **Pytest smoke unreachable**: Test directory not found inside docker-api-1. Cannot verify baseline this run.

### Fixes Applied
- None this run. Phase 70 was deployed before this health check started (16:04 UTC).

### Action Required from Aaron
- **Commit Phase 70 code**: The 4 modified source files + state docs should be committed and pushed so CI can validate the Phase 70 changes. Until then, CI coverage is stale (last CI run tested Phase 69 code, not Phase 70).
- **Monitor Phase 70 daily cap**: Watch the 16:35 UTC cycle — if the daily cap still allows >5 opens, the Phase 70 fix needs further investigation.
- **Pytest smoke path**: Tests not found at `apis/tests/unit/` inside the container. May need to verify the Docker build includes the test directory, or adjust the health-check test path.
