# APIS — Active Context
Last Updated: 2026-04-18 (phantom broker ledger reset + docx state-docs committed 1fa4b31 + pushed; Docker + worker healthy; next paper cycle Mon 2026-04-20 09:35 ET)

## 2026-04-18 Update — Phantom Broker Cleanup + Pre-Existing Tree Edits Resolved

Operator green-lit "let's tackle #2, 3 and 4" (phantom ledger, pre-existing tree edits, Docker signin). Docker Desktop was already back up with all APIS containers healthy — operator must have signed in earlier.

**Pre-existing tree edits (task #3):** Committed two genuine docx state-doc updates as `1fa4b31 docs: refresh APIS operator docs (Daily Ops Guide + Data Dictionary)` and pushed to `origin/main` alongside prior `f46ef7e`. Daily Ops Guide +860 B / 162→175 paragraphs; Data Dictionary -21,815 B / 935→1063 paragraphs. Migration flag on `k1l2m3n4o5p6_add_idempotency_keys.py` was a false-positive stale git stat cache (content hash matched HEAD exactly).

**Phantom broker ledger cleanup (task #2):** Inspected positions and found 13 open rows (cost basis $173,584) from the buggy 2026-04-17 paper cycles — all opened against the crash-triad bug (`_fire_ks() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given`; patched 2026-04-18 at `63fa33e`). Latest portfolio_snapshot showed `cash = -$80,274.62`. Note: `paper_portfolio` table doesn't exist — cash lives in `portfolio_snapshots`.

Executed single-transaction cleanup: `UPDATE positions SET status='closed', closed_at=NOW(), exit_price=entry_price, realized_pnl=0, unrealized_pnl=0, market_value=0 WHERE status='open'` (13 rows) + `INSERT INTO portfolio_snapshots` with cash=$100k / equity=$100k / gross=$0 / note='Phantom broker state reset 2026-04-18 after crash-triad cleanup'. Audit trail preserved (closed rows retain entry price, opened_at, cost basis).

Restarted worker — back healthy in 19s with 35 jobs registered. **Next paper cycle: Monday 2026-04-20 09:35 ET** (Saturday today → markets closed).

**Docker signin (task #4):** Already healthy. No operator action needed.

**State now:** positions 115 closed / 0 open; latest snapshot cash=$100k / equity=$100k; worker + api + postgres + redis + grafana + prometheus + alertmanager + kind all healthy; working tree clean; `main` at `1fa4b31` mirrored to `origin/main`.

## 2026-04-18 Update — `origin` Remote Configured + First Push

`https://github.com/aaronwilson3142-ops/auto-trade-bot.git` added as `origin` (private). `git push -u origin main` succeeded: `new branch main -> main`. Every commit from initial history through `eef10a4` is now mirrored to GitHub; future commits just need `git push`.

---

## 2026-04-18 Update — Repo Hygiene Pass (99b1a5e + efce65b, merged branches deleted)

Follow-on to the triad-drift commit earlier today. Operator gave "yes all that you think you should tackle now" on the autonomous-only items from the prioritised next-steps list.

**Commits added this pass:**
- `99b1a5e docs(state): record post-overnight crash-triad drift commit + scratch sweep` — 4 files, +74/-8 (the 4 state/*.md updates).
- `efce65b chore: persist Deep-Dive planning docs + operator restart scripts` — 4 files, +1353/-0 (APIS_DEEP_DIVE_REVIEW + APIS_EXECUTION_PLAN + 2 restart .bat helpers).

**Cleanup:**
- 45 additional scratch files deleted (see CHANGELOG 2026-04-18 hygiene entry).
- Merged branches `feat/deep-dive-plan-steps-1-6` and `feat/deep-dive-plan-steps-7-8` deleted — `git branch -a` shows only `main`.

**Still flagged / out of scope:**
- Broker restore state `cash = -$80,274.62` + 13 phantom positions remains unresolved (operator ledger decision before Monday 2026-04-20 09:30 ET open).
- 3 pre-existing tree modifications (`APIS Daily Operations Guide.docx`, `APIS_Data_Dictionary.docx`, `apis/infra/db/versions/k1l2m3n4o5p6_add_idempotency_keys.py`) — unchanged.
- `origin` remote still not configured; push deferred until operator supplies URL.

---

## 2026-04-18 Update — Crash-Triad Drift Committed (63fa33e) + Scratch Sweep

Follow-up pass after the overnight Steps 7+8 run. The three code edits that the earlier 2026-04-18 morning entry (below) described as "fixed" had remained as uncommitted local edits; committed them now so `main` matches the documented state.

**Commit:** `63fa33e fix(crash-triad): persist 2026-04-18 morning drift fixes` — 3 files (evaluation ORM attr, idempotency test self_inner rename, HEALTH_LOG entry), +91/-1.

**Repo-root scratch sweep:** 89 files matching the operator's explicit patterns deleted. Remaining `_tmp_*`, `_gs_*`, `_pytest_*`, `_overnight_*` etc. left intact for operator's own review.

**Still flagged, no change:** Broker restore state `cash=-$80,274.62` with 13 positions from the 2026-04-18 morning session remains unresolved; requires operator ledger decision before Monday 2026-04-20 09:30 ET open.

---

## 2026-04-18 Update — Deep-Dive Steps 7 + 8 LANDED on main

Overnight scheduled task `deep-dive-steps-7-8` completed cleanly. Both remaining steps of the 2026-04-16 Deep-Dive Execution Plan are now merged to `main`; all 8 feature flags default OFF so production behaviour is unchanged.

### What landed
- **Step 7 (7009538)** — Shadow Portfolio Scorer + 3 tables + weekly assessment job + 23 tests (DEC-034).
- **Step 8 (d3d2bfe)** — Thompson Strategy Bandit + `strategy_bandit_state` table + closed-trade posterior update hook + 25 tests.
- **Plan A8.6 invariant** — Step 8 posterior updates run **unconditionally** (even when `strategy_bandit_enabled=False`) so the operator gets a warm start when they eventually flip the flag ON.

### Validation
- Step 7 suite: 23/23 passing.
- Step 8 suite: 25/25 passing (99% line coverage on `services/strategy_bandit/service.py`).
- Alembic upgrade head / downgrade -1 / upgrade head against live docker-postgres-1 — both new migrations reversible.

### Merge state
- `main` = `d3d2bfe` (fast-forward from e6b2a3a, 14 files, +2902/-3).
- `feat/deep-dive-plan-steps-7-8` = same commit; can be deleted or kept as checkpoint.
- Push is still deferred — no `origin` remote configured.

### Operator action items
- None required for the flags to stay OFF (behaviour-neutral).
- To begin accumulating bandit priors for real: no action — the closed-trade hook runs on every paper cycle by design. Inspect `strategy_bandit_state` rows after 2 weeks to confirm alpha+beta have grown.
- To enable bandit-weighted ranking later: flip `APIS_STRATEGY_BANDIT_ENABLED=true` after priors are warm AND paper-bake validates the sampled weights.
- To enable shadow parallel rebalancing: flip `APIS_SHADOW_PORTFOLIO_ENABLED=true`; it persists parallel portfolios but does not place real trades.

## 2026-04-18 Update — Paper Cycle Crash-Triad FIX

Yesterday's worker logs (2026-04-17) revealed every paper cycle was crashing before completing. Autonomous health check traced it to three compounding bugs; all fixed today.

### Three fixes applied
1. **`apps/worker/jobs/paper_trading.py`** — `_fire_ks()` signature widened to accept `reason: str` (was 0-arg; `services/broker_adapter/health.py` passes a reason string). Every invariant breach had been crashing with `TypeError`.
2. **`apps/worker/jobs/paper_trading.py`** — added broker-adapter lazy-init block BEFORE the Deep-Dive Step 2 Rec 2 health-invariant check so fresh worker boots with DB-restored positions (Phase 64) don't falsely trip "adapter missing with live positions".
3. **`infra/db/models/evaluation.py`** — added missing `idempotency_key: Mapped[str | None]` on `EvaluationRun` (column was created by Alembic k1l2m3n4o5p6 but ORM wasn't updated; caused `AttributeError` in `_persist_evaluation_run`).

### Bonus
- `tests/unit/test_deep_dive_step2_idempotency_keys.py` — fixed pre-existing mock closure bug (`self._existing` → `self_inner._existing` in `_FakeEvalDb._Result.scalar_one_or_none`).

### Verified
- worker + api restarted healthy; `/health` all `ok`; scheduler registered 35 jobs; next cycle Mon 2026-04-20 09:30 ET (market closed Saturday).
- AST parse + import + `hasattr(EvaluationRun, 'idempotency_key')` all pass.
- Pytest re-run deferred to next interactive session (no docker access from autonomous sandbox).

### ⚠️ Flagged for operator (NOT auto-fixed)
`_load_persisted_state` restored cash=**-$80,274.62** with **13 open positions**. Phase 63 phantom-cash guard requires positions==0, so it doesn't intervene. Operator must decide cleanup path before Monday's open:
- (a) reset paper_portfolio.cash to $100k + delete 13 Position rows;
- (b) wait for Monday cycle to overwrite;
- (c) audit the 13 rows and decide per-position.
See `HEALTH_LOG.md` 2026-04-18 entry and memory `project_paper_cycle_crashtriad_2026-04-18.md` for full context.

## 2026-04-15 Update — Phase A Parts 1 + 2 — Norgate adapter + point-in-time universe behind feature flags

## 2026-04-15 Update — Phase A.2 — Point-in-Time Universe Source

### What landed
- ``apis/services/universe_management/pointintime_source.py`` — ``PointInTimeUniverseService.get_universe_as_of(date)`` returns the S&P 500 members on any historical date, backed by Norgate's ``S&P 500 Current & Past`` watchlist.
- ``APIS_UNIVERSE_SOURCE`` feature flag in ``config/settings.py`` (``static`` default, ``pointintime`` switches).  Also ``APIS_POINTINTIME_INDEX_NAME`` and ``APIS_POINTINTIME_WATCHLIST_NAME`` for future Russell 1000 / NASDAQ 100 swaps.
- 11 unit tests — all passing. Combined Phase A suite = 25/25.
- DEC-025 logged.

### Trial-tier behaviour verified
Live run on 2026-04-15 against Norgate free trial: candidate pool = 541 names.  True survivorship safety requires Platinum (700+ expected).  Service runs correctly at trial tier, just with a smaller universe.

### What this unlocks when Platinum is active
Flipping both flags (``APIS_DATA_SOURCE=pointintime`` + ``APIS_UNIVERSE_SOURCE=pointintime``) makes every downstream consumer — backtest engine, signal generator, ranking, paper cycle — iterate a true survivorship-safe universe with no other code changes.  Phase B (walk-forward) can then proceed.

---

## 2026-04-15 Update — Phase A Part 1 — Survivorship-Free Data Adapter

### What landed
- New adapter `PointInTimeAdapter` (apis/services/data_ingestion/adapters/pointintime_adapter.py) wraps `norgatedata` with the same `fetch_bars` / `fetch_bulk` surface as `YFinanceAdapter`.
- `APIS_DATA_SOURCE` feature flag in `config/settings.py` (enum: `yfinance` default, `pointintime`).  Flip in `.env` to switch.
- Adapter factory in `data_ingestion/service.py` selects by setting; falls back to yfinance if `norgatedata` is unavailable.
- 14 unit tests — all pass without NDU running (see test_pointintime_adapter.py).

### What's blocked
- Norgate 21-day trial caps history at ~2 years; real Phase B walk-forward needs paid subscription (recommended Platinum $630/yr).
- Norgate support declined trial extension 2026-04-15.
- Phases B, B.5, C, D, E, F from APIS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_2026-04-14.md remain pending in sequence.

### Default behaviour is unchanged
`APIS_DATA_SOURCE` defaults to `yfinance`.  Production is untouched until the operator explicitly flips the flag.

## 2026-04-11 Update — Phase 60b Fixes + Autonomous Health Check Authority

### Phase 60b — Three Follow-Up Fixes (deployed 14:40 UTC)
1. **Negative cash_balance fixed:** Broker sync in `paper_trading.py` now adds new positions from broker to `portfolio_state.positions`. Previously only updated existing positions → cash debited but exposure=0 → negative equity → portfolio engine produced 0 opens.
2. **Prometheus DNS fixed:** `prometheus.yml` scrape target corrected from `apis_api:8000` to `api:8000`. `APISScrapeDown` alert should clear.
3. **`last_paper_cycle_at` restored on startup:** `_load_persisted_state()` now sets `last_paper_cycle_at` from latest portfolio snapshot timestamp (with timezone-awareness). Health check shows `paper_cycle: "ok"` instead of `"no_data"` after restarts.

### Autonomous Fix Authority (granted by Aaron)
The daily health check task (`apis-daily-health-check`, 5AM daily) and the Phase 60 monitor task (`phase60-rebalance-monitor`, Monday 09:35 ET one-shot) now have **standing permission to autonomously fix issues** using computer use MCP, Desktop Commander, Chrome MCP, and file tools. No operator approval needed for: container restarts, code edits, test runs, config updates, state file updates.

**Prohibited even with authority:** financial trades, .env secret changes, data deletion, operating mode changes, K8s worker scale-up, auto-execute flag flip.

### Monday 2026-04-14 Monitoring Plan
The `phase60-rebalance-monitor` task fires at 09:35 ET to verify:
- `executed_count > 0` (Phase 60 fix)
- `portfolio_state.equity` stays positive (Phase 60b fix)
- Prometheus `APISScrapeDown` alert cleared (Phase 60b fix)
- `paper_cycle: "ok"` in health check (Phase 60b fix)

## 2026-04-11 Update — Learning Acceleration Reverted + Phase 57 Provider ToS Review

### Learning Acceleration Revert
All three learning-acceleration overrides from 2026-04-09 (DEC-021) have been reverted to production defaults in preparation for live-trading transition:

- **Paper trading cycles reverted 12 → 7**: `apps/worker/main.py` schedule trimmed back to 7 cycles (09:35, 10:30, 11:30, 12:00, 13:30, 14:30, 15:30 ET). Reduces turnover and aligns with standard cadence.
- **Ranking minimum composite score reverted 0.15 → 0.30**: `apis/.env` updated (`APIS_RANKING_MIN_COMPOSITE_SCORE=0.30`). Only high-confidence opportunities will now enter the paper trading candidate list.
- **Max new positions/day reverted 8 → 3**: `apis/.env` updated (`APIS_MAX_NEW_POSITIONS_PER_DAY=3`).
- **Max position age reverted 5 → 20 days**: `apis/.env` updated (`APIS_MAX_POSITION_AGE_DAYS=20`).
- **Production impact**: After restarting Docker services, the worker will run 7 paper cycles/day with tighter filters. No behavioral changes to risk engine or signal generation.

### Paper Trading Schedule (reverted)
- 09:35, 10:30, 11:30, 12:00, 13:30, 14:30, 15:30 ET (7 cycles/day)
- `APIS_MAX_NEW_POSITIONS_PER_DAY=3` (reverted from 8)
- `APIS_MAX_POSITION_AGE_DAYS=20` (reverted from 5)
- `APIS_RANKING_MIN_COMPOSITE_SCORE=0.15` (NEW — was effectively 0.30)

---

## 2026-04-09 Update — Phase 59 (state persistence & startup catch-up)
Dashboard sections were blank after every restart because `ApiAppState` defaults all ~60 fields to None/[]/{}. Only 4 fields (kill_switch, paper_cycle_count, latest_rankings, snapshot_equity) were being restored from DB at startup. This phase fixes the problem with two changes. See `DECISION_LOG.md` DEC-020.

- **`_load_persisted_state()` expanded** — now restores 6 additional data groups from existing DB tables:
  1. `portfolio_state` (cash, HWM, SOD equity, open positions with tickers) from PortfolioSnapshot + Position + Security
  2. `closed_trades` + `trade_grades` (last 200 closed positions, re-derived A/B/C/D/F grades) from Position
  3. `active_weight_profile` (active WeightProfile with parsed weights/Sharpe metrics) from WeightProfile
  4. `current_regime_result` + `regime_history` (last 30 regime snapshots) from RegimeSnapshot
  5. `latest_readiness_report` (gates parsed into ReadinessGateRow objects) from ReadinessSnapshot
  6. `promoted_versions` (all promoted versions, latest per component) from PromotedVersion
- **`_run_startup_catchup()` added** — runs after `_load_persisted_state()` in the lifespan. On weekday mid-day starts, re-runs any morning pipeline jobs whose app_state fields are still empty: correlation, liquidity, VaR, regime, stress test, earnings, universe, rebalance, signal generation, ranking, weight optimization. Skips weekends entirely. Respects dependency ordering.
- **Tests:** `tests/unit/test_phase59_state_persistence.py` — 36 tests across 7 classes (33 pass, 3 skip on Python <3.11 due to `dt.UTC`).
- **Production impact:** Dashboard populates immediately after restart instead of waiting for next scheduled job. Startup takes ~30-60s longer on weekday mid-day restarts due to catch-up jobs.

## 2026-04-08 Update — Phase 58 (self-improvement auto-execute safety gates)
A second session on 2026-04-08 tightened the self-improvement loop after a live-money readiness review showed the auto-execute path had (a) no enabled/disabled flag, (b) no minimum observation count for the signal quality report it depends on, and (c) a latent bug where `run_auto_execute_proposals` never passed `min_confidence` to the service, making the documented 0.70 confidence gate dead code. See `DECISION_LOG.md` DEC-019 for full rationale.

- **Changes:** `config/settings.py` gained three new fields — `self_improvement_auto_execute_enabled` (default **False**, explicit operator opt-in), `self_improvement_min_auto_execute_confidence` (default 0.70), `self_improvement_min_signal_quality_observations` (default 10). `apps/worker/jobs/self_improvement.run_auto_execute_proposals` now reads all three, short-circuits with `status="skipped_disabled"` or `status="skipped_insufficient_history"` as appropriate, and actually passes `min_confidence` through to `AutoExecutionService.auto_execute_promoted`.
- **Tests:** `tests/unit/test_phase35_auto_execution.py` — `_make_app_state` now seeds a `SignalQualityReport` with 50 outcomes; `_make_promoted_proposal` defaults `confidence_score=0.80`; 5 existing `TestAutoExecuteWorkerJob` tests updated to pass an enabled `Settings`; 6 new Phase 58 tests cover: disabled-by-default, service-not-called-when-disabled, skip-on-thin-history, skip-on-missing-report, skip-on-low-confidence, execute-on-high-confidence. All 13 tests in `TestAutoExecuteWorkerJob` pass under Python 3.12.
- **Production impact:** auto-execute is now OFF by default. The `auto_execute_proposals` scheduler job still runs at 18:15 ET every weekday but returns a no-op status until the operator sets `APIS_SELF_IMPROVEMENT_AUTO_EXECUTE_ENABLED=true`. Proposal generation and promotion are unchanged — those keep building evidence during the paper bake period.
- **Operator action required:** do NOT flip the flag until after the PAPER → HUMAN_APPROVED gate has passed and `latest_signal_quality.total_outcomes_recorded >= 10`. When the flag is flipped, double-check the readiness report shows `signal_quality_win_rate` gate = PASS, not WARN.

## 2026-04-08 Update — Phase 57 opened
A new signal family is being added in response to a review of the Samin Yasar "Claude Just Changed the Stock Market Forever" tutorial (YouTube `lH5wrfNwL3k`). See `DECISION_LOG.md` DEC-018 and `NEXT_STEPS.md` Phase 57 for the full plan. This session shipped Part 1 only — scaffold, no wiring.

- **In scope:** congressional / 13F / unusual-options flow as a 6th signal family feeding the existing composite ranking alongside momentum / theme / macro / sentiment / valuation.
- **Explicitly out of scope:** options strategies of any kind (Master Spec §4.2), ladder-in averaging-down rules (Master Spec §9), wholesale copy-trading a single actor, replacing any existing strategy.
- **Files added this session:** `services/signal_engine/strategies/insider_flow.py`, `services/data_ingestion/adapters/insider_flow_adapter.py`, `tests/unit/test_phase57_insider_flow.py` (24 tests, all passing).
- **Files modified this session:** `services/feature_store/models.py` (+3 overlay fields on `FeatureSet`), `services/signal_engine/models.py` (+`SignalType.INSIDER_FLOW`), `services/signal_engine/strategies/__init__.py` (+export).
- **Production impact:** zero. The new strategy is not wired into `SignalEngineService.score_from_features()`. Default adapter is `NullInsiderFlowAdapter` which always returns an empty event list, and the `FeatureSet` overlay fields default to neutral, so the strategy would emit a 0.5 signal with zero confidence even if it were wired.
- **Next session entry point:** Phase 57 Part 2 — provider ToS review (QuiverQuant / Finnhub / SEC EDGAR), then concrete adapter + enrichment wiring + settings flag (`APIS_ENABLE_INSIDER_FLOW_STRATEGY=False` default) + walk-forward backtest via `BacktestEngine`. Log provider choice as DEC-019 **before** writing any code.

## Pre-2026-04-08 context (unchanged below)
Last Updated before this amendment: 2026-03-31 (Ops — Securities table seed fix + worker volume mount)

## What APIS Is
An Autonomous Portfolio Intelligence System for U.S. equities. A disciplined, modular, auditable portfolio operating system: ingests market/macro/news/politics/rumor signals, ranks equity ideas, manages a paper portfolio under strict risk rules, grades itself daily, and improves itself in a controlled way.

## Current Operational Status
**System running via Docker Compose (primary). All containers healthy. Paper trading runs 7 intraday cycles per trading day. Securities table seeded — signal generation should produce real signals starting 2026-04-01.**

### Paper Trading Schedule
- 09:35, 10:30, 11:30, 12:00, 13:30, 14:30, 15:30 ET (7 cycles/day — reverted from 12)
- `APIS_MAX_NEW_POSITIONS_PER_DAY=3` (reverted from 8)
- `APIS_MAX_POSITION_AGE_DAYS=20` (reverted from 5)
- `APIS_RANKING_MIN_COMPOSITE_SCORE=0.30` (reverted from 0.15)

### Runtime: Docker Compose (primary)
- `docker-api-1` — Up, healthy, port 8000
- `docker-worker-1` — Up, healthy, recreated 2026-03-31 with source volume mount
- `docker-postgres-1` — Up, healthy, port 5432 (8+ days uptime)
- `docker-redis-1` — Up, healthy, port 6379 (8+ days uptime)
- `docker-prometheus-1` — Up, port 9090
- `docker-grafana-1` — Up, port 3000
- `docker-alertmanager-1` — Up, port 9093
- Dashboard: `http://localhost:8000/dashboard/`

### Runtime: Kubernetes kind cluster "apis" (secondary)
- API pod on NodePort 30800
- Worker scaled to 0 (intentional — Docker Compose is primary)
- Postgres + Redis running internally

### Config notes
- `apis/.env`: `APIS_OPERATING_MODE=paper` ✅
- Alpaca broker auth: API keys present in `.env` — may need refresh if "unauthorized" persists
- Worker now has source volume mount (`../../../apis:/app/apis:ro`) matching API service — code changes take effect on restart without rebuild
- **IMPORTANT:** When running `docker compose up` from `apis/infra/docker/`, must pass `--env-file "../../.env"` for Grafana password interpolation

### Key Issue Fixed This Session (2026-03-31)
- **`securities` table was empty** — never seeded after DB schema creation. Signal generation skipped all 62 universe tickers ("No security_id found") → 0 signals → 0 rankings → all 7 paper trading cycles skipping with `skipped_no_rankings` every day since system went live.
- **Fix:** Seeded 62 securities + 13 themes + 62 security_theme mappings into Postgres. Created `infra/db/seed_securities.py` (idempotent seed script). Hooked into worker startup via `_seed_reference_data()` in `main.py`. Added volume mount to worker service in `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Expected result:** Tomorrow (2026-04-01) morning pipeline at 06:30 ET will generate real signals → rankings → paper trading cycles will execute for the first time at scale.

## Current Build Stage
**Phase 56 — Readiness Report History — COMPLETE. 3626/3626 tests (100 skipped).**
  - `infra/db/models/readiness.py` — `ReadinessSnapshot` ORM model: id, captured_at, overall_status, current_mode, target_mode, pass/warn/fail/gate_count, gates_json, recommendation + TimestampMixin
  - `infra/db/versions/j0k1l2m3n4o5_add_readiness_snapshots.py` — Alembic migration (down_revision: i9j0k1l2m3n4)
  - `infra/db/models/__init__.py` — export `ReadinessSnapshot`
  - `services/readiness/service.py` — `persist_snapshot(report, session_factory)` static method: fire-and-forget, serializes gates to JSON, never raises
  - `apps/worker/jobs/readiness.py` — `run_readiness_report_update` now accepts `session_factory` param; calls `persist_snapshot` on success
  - `apps/worker/main.py` — `_job_readiness_report_update` passes `session_factory`
  - `apps/api/schemas/readiness.py` — `ReadinessSnapshotSchema`, `ReadinessHistoryResponse`
  - `apps/api/routes/readiness.py` — `GET /system/readiness-report/history` (200 + empty list; limit 1-100 default 10; DB error degrades to empty)
  - `apps/dashboard/router.py` — `_render_readiness_history_table()` helper; wired into `_render_readiness_section`; section renamed to include Phase 56
  - 60 tests; no new job (stays 30 total); 5 strategies unchanged

**ALL PLANNED PHASES COMPLETE. APIS system build finished.**

**Phase 55 — Fill Quality Alpha-Decay Attribution — COMPLETE. 3566/3566 tests (100 skipped).**
  - `services/fill_quality/models.py` — Added `alpha_captured_pct`, `slippage_as_pct_of_move` to `FillQualityRecord`; new `AlphaDecaySummary` dataclass
  - `services/fill_quality/service.py` — `compute_alpha_decay(record, subsequent_price, n_days)` + `compute_attribution_summary(records, n_days, computed_at)`
  - `apps/worker/jobs/fill_quality_attribution.py` — NEW `run_fill_quality_attribution` job: enriches fill_quality_records with alpha data, computes summary, writes to app_state
  - `apps/api/schemas/fill_quality.py` — `AlphaDecaySummarySchema`, `FillAttributionResponse`; alpha fields added to `FillQualityRecordSchema`
  - `apps/api/routes/fill_quality.py` — `GET /portfolio/fill-quality/attribution` (200 + empty on no data, BEFORE parameterized `/{ticker}` route)
  - `apps/api/state.py` — 2 new fields: `fill_quality_attribution_summary`, `fill_quality_attribution_updated_at`
  - `apps/worker/jobs/__init__.py` — export `run_fill_quality_attribution`

## Components Not Yet Built
- Integration / E2E tests against live Schwab / IBKR paper accounts (require real credentials)
- Database-backed secrets rotation: AWSSecretManager.invalidate_cache() hook on AWS rotation event
- Operating mode transition checklist: research → paper pre-flight runbook

## Current Architecture Decisions
- APScheduler v3 BackgroundScheduler — in-process (no Redis job queue for MVP)
- Session factory (`SessionLocal`) is injected into DB-backed jobs; None-safe fallback for no-DB environments
- All job functions return a structured result dict for observability
- Exceptions are always caught inside job functions (scheduler thread must not die)

- `services/self_improvement/service.py` — SelfImprovementService: generate_proposals (scorecard + attribution → proposals, capped at max_proposals_per_cycle), evaluate_proposal (guardrail + metric threshold checks), promote_or_reject (promotion guard: no self-approval, all decisions traceable)
Phase 7 next: Paper Trading Integration (Alpaca adapter) → Gate F QA.

## Current Operating Mode
**research** (paper/live not yet active)

## Components That Exist
- `README.md`, `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `.env.example`, `.gitignore` — top-level files
- `state/` — all 5 state files created (this session)
- `config/settings.py` — pydantic-settings config (created this session)
- `config/logging_config.py` — structlog config (created this session)
- `broker_adapters/base/` — abstract BrokerAdapter, domain models, exceptions (created this session)
- `broker_adapters/paper/` — full paper broker implementation (created this session)
- `services/` — 16 service stubs with `__init__.py`, `service.py`, `models.py`, `schemas.py` placeholders
- `apps/api/`, `apps/worker/`, `apps/dashboard/` — app stubs
- `tests/` — test harness scaffold + Gate A tests
- `infra/`, `scripts/`, `research/`, `data/`, `models/`, `strategies/` — directory stubs

## Components Built
- **config/universe.py** — trading universe config, 50 tickers, 8 segments
- **data_ingestion** — YFinanceAdapter + DataIngestionService (ingest_universe_bars, get_or_create_security, persist_bars)
- **feature_store** — BaselineFeaturePipeline (11 feature keys), FeatureStoreService (compute_and_persist, get_features, ensure_feature_catalog)
- **signal_engine** — MomentumStrategy (score → SignalOutput with full explanation), SignalEngineService (run + score_from_features)
- **ranking_engine** — RankingEngineService (rank_signals + run DB path, full Gate B compliance)

## Components Not Yet Built
- market_data, news_intelligence, macro_policy_engine, theme_engine, rumor_scoring services (Phase 5+)
- FastAPI app with routes
- ~~portfolio_engine, risk_engine, execution_engine~~ — COMPLETE
- Alpaca live adapter
- IBKR adapter
- ~~Evaluation engine~~ — COMPLETE
- ~~Self-improvement engine~~ — COMPLETE

## Current Architecture Decisions
- Python 3.11+
- FastAPI for API layer
- SQLAlchemy 2.0 + Alembic (PostgreSQL)
- Redis for cache/queue
- pydantic-settings for config
- structlog for structured logging
- BrokerAdapter abstract base with paper broker first
- APScheduler for background jobs
- alpaca-py official SDK for Alpaca adapter

## Current Restrictions
- Long-only, no margin, no leverage, no options
- Max 10 positions
- Paper trading only until Gate F passes
- All risk checks mandatory (no bypass)
- Self-improvement proposals cannot self-promote

## Infrastructure Status
- **PostgreSQL 17.9**: Running (`postgresql-x64-17` service). Databases: `apis`, `apis_test`. Connection: `postgresql+psycopg://postgres:ApisDev2026!@localhost:5432/apis`
- **Redis**: Not yet installed (needed for Phase 3+, not a Phase 2 blocker)
- **psql PATH**: `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\17\bin` added to user PATH
- **.env**: Created with real connection strings
- **Phase 2 packages**: sqlalchemy 2.0.48, alembic 1.18.4, psycopg 3.3.3, redis 7.3.0 installed in venv

## Current Risks
- No data provider finalized (yfinance for dev, real feed for paper/live)
- Redis not yet installed (needed for Phase 3+ caching/queuing)
- No Alpaca keys configured yet
- ORM models have columns only; no ORM relationships defined yet (add when service layer needs them)
- DB schema / Alembic migrations not yet written

## Current Truth
Session 1 complete. Phase 1 (Foundation Scaffolding) is DONE. Gate A passed 44/44. No data is flowing yet, no services running. The next session begins with Phase 2: Alembic setup and SQLAlchemy ORM models (all tables from DATABASE_AND_SCHEMA_SPEC.md). PostgreSQL must be provisioned before Phase 2 DB testing.

Python version in use: 3.14.3 (higher than our 3.11 minimum — verified compatible).
Virtual environment: `apis/.venv/`
Test command: `$env:PYTHONPATH = "."; .\.venv\Scripts\pytest.exe tests/unit/ --no-cov`
