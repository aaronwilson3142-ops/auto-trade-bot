# APIS — Next Steps
Last Updated: 2026-04-18 (Phase 57 Part 2 concrete insider-flow adapters landed default-OFF on `main` + pushed; 358/360 targeted sweep; 2 failures pre-existing scheduler drift; next paper cycle Mon 2026-04-20 09:35 ET unchanged)

## COMPLETE — Phase 57 Part 2 Landed Default-OFF (2026-04-18)

Phase 57 ("insider/smart-money flow" signal family) is now fully wired end-to-end — Part 1 scaffold + Part 2 concrete providers. Both sit behind default-OFF credential gates per DEC-036: unknown provider, missing API key, or missing SEC User-Agent all degrade to `NullInsiderFlowAdapter` with a WARNING — never a crash. Production behaviour is byte-for-byte identical until the operator:
1. Reviews QuiverQuant ToS for APIS's programmatic-ingestion use-case.
2. Sets `APIS_INSIDER_FLOW_PROVIDER=quiverquant` (or `sec_edgar`/`composite`) in `apis/.env`.
3. Sets the matching credential (`APIS_QUIVERQUANT_API_KEY` and/or `APIS_SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT=<real contact>`).
4. For EDGAR: threads a `ticker_to_cik` map into the factory (currently passes `None` so tickers without CIK silently skip).
5. Flips `APIS_ENABLE_INSIDER_FLOW_STRATEGY=true` so the `InsiderFlowStrategy` reads the populated overlay.

See CHANGELOG entry dated 2026-04-18 + DEC-036 for full diff and rationale. 31 new unit tests + 358/360 cross-step sweep.

**Removed from this queue.** Phase 57 Part 2 was the only pending item on the 2026-04-18 5-item triage list; all 5 are now complete:
1. ✅ `.env.example` template bump to `APIS_MAX_THEMATIC_PCT=0.75` (commit `4a02fd3`).
2. ✅ Delete `_restart_worker_api.bat` scratch file.
3. ✅ Monday cycle watch plan + checker script (commit `ca6278b` + `0ef6a0c`).
4. ✅ **Phase 57 Part 2 concrete adapters (this commit).**
5. ✅ Learning-acceleration rollback PR (commit `0ef6a0c`).

## PRIORITY — Monday 2026-04-20 09:35 ET Baseline Paper Cycle (unchanged)

**Hard rule:** Do NOT flip any Deep-Dive behavioural flag before the Monday baseline cycle runs. Today's `d08875d` is metadata-only — all 11 Deep-Dive flags remain default-OFF.

**Watch-list for the 09:35 ET cycle:**
- Cycle completes without `broker_adapter_missing_with_live_positions` or `_fire_ks()` errors.
- Trades open against clean $100k cash (no phantom broker ledger restoration).
- New `positions` rows carry non-NULL `origin_strategy` — spot-check with `SELECT ticker, origin_strategy, opened_at FROM positions WHERE status='open' ORDER BY opened_at DESC LIMIT 10;`.
- A new `portfolio_snapshots` row is written by the cycle itself (not by our manual 2026-04-18 cleanup insert).

If all four hold, operator can begin flipping Step 6 / Step 8 flags one at a time with post-flip monitoring per the Deep-Dive execution plan.

## COMPLETE — Deep-Dive Step 5 `origin_strategy` Wiring (Deferred Finisher, 2026-04-18)

The only deferred item from the 2026-04-16 Deep-Dive review has landed on `main` at `d08875d` and been pushed to `origin/main`. The Step 5 column (`positions.origin_strategy`) was already on the live DB from the 2026-04-17 migration, but the paper-trading open-path wasn't writing to it — so the Step 6 Proposal Outcome Ledger and Step 8 Thompson Strategy Bandit had no way to attribute realised P&L. That gap is now closed.

See CHANGELOG entry dated 2026-04-18 for full diff, test coverage (16 new + 236 sweep passes), and semantics (backfill-but-never-overwrite).

## COMPLETE — Deep-Dive Execution Plan (2026-04-16 → 2026-04-18) + Crash-Triad Drift + Repo Hygiene (2026-04-18)

All 8 steps of the 2026-04-16 Deep-Dive Execution Plan are merged to `main`. Every flag introduced by the plan defaults OFF, so production behaviour is byte-for-byte unchanged until the operator opts in. Post-overnight handoff landed three documentation/hygiene commits on 2026-04-18: the triad drift (`63fa33e`), session-state docs (`99b1a5e`), and planning-docs + operator scripts (`efce65b`). 45 additional scratch files deleted; both fully-merged feature branches pruned.

### Final git state (2026-04-18 post-hygiene)
`main` = **efce65b** (`chore: persist Deep-Dive planning docs + operator restart scripts`, 4 files, +1353/-0) → 99b1a5e → 63fa33e → fb9ecff → d3d2bfe → 7009538 → e6b2a3a → … .

Branches: only `main` remains (`feat/deep-dive-plan-steps-1-6` and `feat/deep-dive-plan-steps-7-8` deleted after merge verification).

- `fb9ecff` docs(deep-dive): update state files after Steps 7-8 merge to main
- `d3d2bfe` feat(deep-dive): Step 8 — Thompson Strategy Bandit (Rec 12) [+25 tests]
- `7009538` feat(deep-dive): Step 7 — Shadow Portfolio Scorer (DEC-034) [+23 tests]

Combined Step 7+8 delta: 14 files, +2902 / −3. Both Alembic migrations verified reversible against live docker-postgres-1 (`upgrade head → downgrade -1 → upgrade head`).

`feat/deep-dive-plan-steps-7-8` still exists at d3d2bfe. Push remains deferred (no `origin` remote).

### Repo hygiene (2026-04-18 — DONE)
- **First pass (pre-hygiene, already completed):** 89 scratch artifacts in the repo root matching `_alembic_*.txt` / `_git_*.txt` / `_step8_pytest*` / `_commit_*.txt` / `_docker_ps.txt*` / `_run_step8_validation.ps1` — deleted.
- **Second pass (this session, 2026-04-18 post-triad):** 45 additional scratch files deleted — `_tmp_*` / `_g1..g4e.txt` / `_overnight_steps_7_8_report.txt` / `_pytest_*` / `_run_phase64_validate*.bat` / `_run_step7_validation.ps1` / `_step7_validation_out.txt` / `_run_full_tests.ps1` / `_full_tests_*.txt` / `_test_sync.txt` / `_git_status.ps1` / zero-byte `'` + `Run` + `apis/_tmp_check.py` + `apis/check_db.py` + `apis/infra/docker/tmp_query.sql` + `apis/state/_tmp_query.sql` + `apis/state/trim_log.py` + `norgate_*.py` (3) + `state/Test_Results.txt`.
- **Planning docs + operator scripts persisted (`efce65b`):** `APIS_DEEP_DIVE_REVIEW_2026-04-16.md`, `APIS_EXECUTION_PLAN_2026-04-16.md`, `restart_apis_stack.bat`, `restart_worker_for_universe_expansion.bat` — all moved from untracked-noise into the tree.
- **Merged branches deleted:** `feat/deep-dive-plan-steps-1-6` (was e6b2a3a) and `feat/deep-dive-plan-steps-7-8` (was d3d2bfe).

### Pre-existing uncommitted edits still in tree
All resolved 2026-04-18:
- `APIS Daily Operations Guide.docx` + `APIS_Data_Dictionary.docx` → committed as `1fa4b31 docs: refresh APIS operator docs (Daily Ops Guide + Data Dictionary)` and pushed to `origin/main`.
- `apis/infra/db/versions/k1l2m3n4o5p6_add_idempotency_keys.py` → false-positive stale stat cache (content hash matched HEAD); cleared via `git checkout HEAD -- <path>`.

### Remaining autonomous-path follow-ups
- **`origin` remote:** DONE 2026-04-18. Now points at `https://github.com/aaronwilson3142-ops/auto-trade-bot.git` (private). `main` at `1fa4b31` mirrored to `origin/main`. Future commits just need `git push`.
- **Phantom broker state:** DONE 2026-04-18. 13 phantom positions closed at entry price (realized_pnl=0); fresh clean `portfolio_snapshots` row at cash=$100k / equity=$100k / gross=$0; worker restarted healthy. Audit trail preserved. Logs confirmed the phantom rows were products of every 2026-04-17 paper cycle crashing on the now-patched triad signature (`_fire_ks() takes 0 positional arguments but 1 was given`).
- **3 pre-existing tree modifications:** DONE 2026-04-18 (see above).
- **Docker Desktop signin:** DONE 2026-04-18. Docker Desktop + all APIS containers are healthy (api, worker, postgres, redis, grafana, prometheus, alertmanager, kind). Operator must already have signed in earlier. `project_docker_desktop_autostart_blocker.md` memory remains valid as a heads-up for future reboots.

### Watch-list for Monday 2026-04-20 09:35 ET
- First paper cycle after cleanup. Expect: zero errors, opening positions against clean $100k cash, new portfolio_snapshots row written by the cycle itself.
- If `broker_adapter_missing_with_live_positions` or `_fire_ks()` errors reappear → drift regression; bisect against `63fa33e` + `7009538`/`d3d2bfe`.

## IN PROGRESS — Deep-Dive Execution Plan (2026-04-16) [HISTORICAL]

Autonomous scheduled-task run `apis-execution-plan-step-1` is executing the full 8-step plan back-to-back per operator's authorisation. Per-step workflow: grep → implement → test → migrate → update state files → advance. No pausing between steps except on test failure.

### Git state (2026-04-17 08:23 CT — POST-MERGE)
`main` has been fast-forwarded from 7b0c376 → **e6b2a3a**. All 8 Deep-Dive commits are now on `main`:
- 9f37a47 chore: capture pre-deep-dive uncommitted repo state (67 files, +11026 / -3464)
- f8c6889 feat(deep-dive): Step 1 — un-bury 6 hard-coded constants into settings (+255 tests)
- 2d83cc3 feat(deep-dive): Step 2 — stability invariants + idempotency keys + observation floor 10→50 (+1491)
- e9cd8b5 feat(deep-dive): Step 3 — trade-count lift (lower buy threshold + conditional ranking-min) (+261)
- 614ed1e feat(deep-dive): Step 4 — score-weighted rebalance allocator with floor/cap guardrails (+579)
- 1b4995d feat(deep-dive): Step 5 — ATR-scaled per-family stops + portfolio_fit sizing (+605)
- bbe6855 feat(deep-dive): Step 6 — Proposal Outcome Ledger with per-type measurement windows (DEC-035) (+1705 / -42)
- e6b2a3a docs(deep-dive): update state files after commit phase (state file docs + push-deferral note)

Merge summary: 90 files changed, +15957 / −3505 on the fast-forward. Flag defaults all OFF → behavior-neutral in production. `feat/deep-dive-plan-steps-1-6` still exists at the same commit (can be deleted or kept as checkpoint).

Push to remote is deferred — this repo has no `origin` remote configured. Commits are durable locally.

### Scheduled — Steps 7 + 8 (overnight run 2026-04-17 23:00 CT)
Scheduled task `deep-dive-steps-7-8` fires once at 2026-04-17 23:00 America/Chicago. Plan:
- Branch `feat/deep-dive-plan-steps-7-8` off main at e6b2a3a
- Step 7: `ShadowPortfolioService` + 3 new tables + weekly assessment job + parallel rebalance-weighting shadows (DEC-034)
- Step 8: `StrategyBanditService` + `strategy_bandit_state` table + closed-trade hook + clamps (flag OFF, state still accumulates per plan §8.6)
- Flags default OFF. Alembic smoke-test each migration (up/down/up). 40+ new tests target.
- Fast-forward merge to main, write `_overnight_steps_7_8_report.txt` when done.
- Blocker path → `wip/` branch, no merge, SESSION_HANDOFF_LOG entry.

Task file: `C:\Users\aaron\OneDrive\Documents\Claude\Scheduled\deep-dive-steps-7-8\SKILL.md`

### Step status
- **Step 1** — Un-bury 6 hard-coded constants — **DONE 2026-04-16**. 24 tests added (23 pass, 1 skipped for sandbox Python 3.10 only). Pure refactor; defaults byte-for-byte preserved (DEC-032).
- **Step 2** — Broker-adapter health invariant + action conflict detector + idempotency keys + observation floor 10→50 — **DONE 2026-04-17**. 32 tests added (21 pass + 11 skipped for sandbox Python 3.10). Alembic migration `k1l2m3n4o5p6_add_idempotency_keys` written; operator must run `alembic upgrade head` against prod PG before cycle_id-keyed writes take effect. 2 safety flags default ON per DEC-031.
- **Step 3** — Lower buy threshold 0.65→0.55 (flag `APIS_LOWER_BUY_THRESHOLD_ENABLED`, OFF) + conditional ranking-min 0.30→0.20 for held-with-positive-history (flag `APIS_CONDITIONAL_RANKING_MIN_ENABLED`, OFF) — **DONE 2026-04-17**. 21 tests added, all pass. Cross-step sweep 65 pass + 12 skipped. Both flags default OFF → no behaviour change until operator opts in.
- **Step 4** — New `services/rebalancing_engine/allocator.py` with equal / score / score_invvol modes + floor/cap guardrails. Settings `APIS_REBALANCE_WEIGHTING_METHOD="equal"` + master switch `APIS_SCORE_WEIGHTED_REBALANCE_ENABLED=False` (both required to activate). Worker `rebalancing.py` branches on flags. — **DONE 2026-04-17**. 23 tests added, all pass. Cross-step sweep 88 pass + 12 skipped. Flag default OFF → no behaviour change until operator opts in.
- **Step 5** — ATR stops + `FAMILY_PARAMS` + `Position.origin_strategy` + migration `l2m3n4o5p6q7` + `portfolio_fit_score` into sizing. Settings `APIS_ATR_STOPS_ENABLED` + `APIS_PORTFOLIO_FIT_SIZING_ENABLED` both default OFF. — **DONE 2026-04-17**. 38 tests added, all pass. Cross-step sweep 126 pass + 12 skipped. origin_strategy wiring into paper_trading open-path deferred (crosses idempotency-sensitive code); safe to defer because default family is wider/longer than legacy. Operator must run `alembic upgrade head` before flipping ATR flag.
- **Step 6** — `proposal_outcomes` table + migration `m3n4o5p6q7r8` + daily-assessment worker stub + per-type windows (DEC-035) + generator feedback loop + settings flags. Flag `APIS_PROPOSAL_OUTCOME_LEDGER_ENABLED` default OFF. — **DONE 2026-04-17** (Part A). 19 tests (16 pass + 3 Python-3.10 sandbox skip, following Step 5 precedent). Cross-step sweep 142 pass + 15 skipped. Two overnight-artifact bugs fixed during morning verification: (a) `get_session_factory` → `SessionLocal`, (b) 3 tests skipped for dt.UTC-on-3.10. Worker-job APScheduler wiring + real metric computation deferred to Step 6 **Part B**.
- **Step 7** — `shadow_portfolios`/`shadow_positions`/`shadow_trades` tables + weekly job + parallel rebalance-weighting shadows (DEC-034). Flag `APIS_SHADOW_PORTFOLIO_ENABLED` OFF. — **DONE 2026-04-18** (commit 7009538). 23 tests passing. Alembic migration n4o5p6q7r8s9 reversible.
- **Step 8** — `strategy_bandit_state` table + `StrategyBanditService` + closed-trade hook + clamps. Flag `APIS_STRATEGY_BANDIT_ENABLED` OFF (but bandit state accumulates from closed trades even with flag OFF, per plan §8.6). — **DONE 2026-04-18** (commit d3d2bfe). 25 tests passing. Alembic migration o5p6q7r8s9t0 reversible. `last_sampled_weight` stored as Numeric(18, 16) so cached float64 draws round-trip bit-for-bit between cycles.

### Operator action items after run completes
- [ ] Review CHANGELOG entries for Steps 1–8.
- [ ] Run paper-bake per step's acceptance criteria before flipping any behavioral flag.
- [ ] Keep DEC-033 9 hard risk gates intact (unchanged by any step).

## Phase 59 — State Persistence & Startup Catch-Up (DONE 2026-04-09)

## Phase 59 — State Persistence & Startup Catch-Up (DONE 2026-04-09)

**Trigger:** Dashboard sections blank after every restart — `ApiAppState` only restored 4 of ~60 fields from DB. See DECISION_LOG DEC-020.

- [x] `apps/api/main.py` — `_load_persisted_state()` expanded with 6 new restoration blocks (portfolio_state, closed_trades/trade_grades, active_weight_profile, regime_result/history, readiness_report, promoted_versions)
- [x] `apps/api/main.py` — `_run_startup_catchup()` added to re-run missed morning pipeline jobs on weekday mid-day starts
- [x] `tests/unit/test_phase59_state_persistence.py` — 36 tests across 7 classes, 33 pass / 3 skip (Python <3.11)
- [x] `state/CHANGELOG.md`, `state/DECISION_LOG.md`, `state/ACTIVE_CONTEXT.md`, `state/NEXT_STEPS.md` updated

---

## Phase 58 — Self-Improvement Auto-Execute Safety Gates (DONE 2026-04-08)

**Trigger:** Live-money readiness review on 2026-04-08. Two issues found: (a) `run_auto_execute_proposals` never passed `min_confidence` to the service, so the documented 0.70 confidence gate was dead code; (b) the job had no guard against running with a near-empty signal-quality history, which is exactly the bot's state after only ~5 trading days of real signals. See DECISION_LOG DEC-019.

- [x] `config/settings.py` — 3 new fields: `self_improvement_auto_execute_enabled` (default **False**), `self_improvement_min_auto_execute_confidence` (default 0.70), `self_improvement_min_signal_quality_observations` (default 10)
- [x] `apps/worker/jobs/self_improvement.run_auto_execute_proposals` rewritten with 3 gates (master switch, observation floor, per-proposal confidence pass-through)
- [x] `tests/unit/test_phase35_auto_execution.py` — helpers updated, 5 existing tests modified, 6 new Phase 58 tests added. All 13 worker-job tests pass.

### Follow-ups for the operator (when ready)
- [ ] When the PAPER → HUMAN_APPROVED readiness gate is about to PASS, manually inspect the latest few PROMOTED proposals from `app_state.improvement_proposals` to sanity-check that their `confidence_score` values track something meaningful.
- [ ] Confirm `latest_signal_quality.total_outcomes_recorded >= 10` via `GET /system/readiness-report`.
- [ ] Flip `APIS_SELF_IMPROVEMENT_AUTO_EXECUTE_ENABLED=true` in `apis/.env` and restart the worker container. Do NOT do this before the readiness report is green.
- [ ] After flipping, watch the 18:15 ET `auto_execute_proposals` job result for a week and confirm `skipped_low_confidence` and `executed_count` are both non-trivial — a zero-on-both run means the confidence distribution is bimodal at the edges and the threshold may need retuning.

---

## Phase 57 — Insider / Smart-Money Flow Signal (IN PROGRESS)

**Trigger:** Review of Samin Yasar "Claude Just Changed the Stock Market Forever" tutorial (YouTube `lH5wrfNwL3k`). The tutorial's real contribution is the *data source* (congressional disclosures + 13F + unusual options flow), not its strategies. Options-wheel portion of the tutorial is **explicitly out of scope** per Master Spec §4.2. See `DECISION_LOG.md` DEC-018.

### Part 1 — Scaffold (DONE 2026-04-08)
- [x] `services/signal_engine/strategies/insider_flow.py` — `InsiderFlowStrategy` (stateless, exponential decay half-life=14d, hard cut at 60d, reliability tier capped at `secondary_verified`, `contains_rumor=False` always, horizon=POSITIONAL)
- [x] `services/data_ingestion/adapters/insider_flow_adapter.py` — `InsiderFlowAdapter` ABC + `InsiderFlowEvent` dataclass + `InsiderFlowOverlay` dataclass + `NullInsiderFlowAdapter` default
- [x] `services/feature_store/models.py` — add overlay fields `insider_flow_score`, `insider_flow_confidence`, `insider_flow_age_days`
- [x] `services/signal_engine/models.py` — add `SignalType.INSIDER_FLOW` enum member
- [x] `services/signal_engine/strategies/__init__.py` — register `InsiderFlowStrategy`
- [x] `tests/unit/test_phase57_insider_flow.py` — 24 tests, all passing (scaffold defaults, decay math, aggregation, reliability, rumour-flag invariant)

### Part 2 — Provider Selection & Wiring (IN PROGRESS)
- [x] **Provider ToS review** — evaluated QuiverQuant, Finnhub, SEC EDGAR. **Selected QuiverQuant (primary, congressional) + SEC EDGAR Form 4/13F (supplementary, insider/institutional).** Finnhub rejected (unclear ToS, undocumented fields). Logged as DEC-023 on 2026-04-11.
- [ ] **Concrete adapter** implementing `InsiderFlowAdapter.fetch_events()` with rate-limiting, backoff, and row-level parse-error swallowing
- [ ] **Enrichment wiring** — extend the feature enrichment pipeline (Phase 22) to call `adapter.fetch_events()` + `adapter.aggregate()` per ticker and populate the three `FeatureSet.insider_flow_*` overlay fields
- [ ] **SignalEngineService** — add `InsiderFlowStrategy` to the default strategies list in `SignalEngineService.score_from_features()` (behind a settings flag, default OFF)
- [ ] **Settings flag** — `APIS_ENABLE_INSIDER_FLOW_STRATEGY: bool = False` in `config/settings.py`, default OFF, so even after Part 2 lands the strategy produces zero effect until explicitly enabled

### Part 3 — Validation Gate (MUST PASS BEFORE ENABLING)
- [ ] **Walk-forward backtest** via `BacktestEngine` (Phase 24) across ≥2 years of historical congressional disclosure + price data, with realistic transaction costs, slippage, and the existing risk-engine stack active. Document Sharpe, max drawdown, win rate, and turnover with and without the insider-flow signal blended in.
- [ ] **Sensitivity analysis** — re-run the backtest with the insider-flow strategy weight at 0.00, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15 to find the Pareto-optimal weight under the existing Phase 37 auto-tuner framework.
- [ ] **LiveModeGateService readiness report** must still PASS with the new signal weight in place — including the Phase 51 Sharpe / drawdown-state / signal-quality gates.
- [ ] **Integration test** — extend `tests/integration/` with a fixture-driven enrichment → signal → rank → paper-trade loop exercising the new signal family.
- [ ] **Only then** flip `APIS_ENABLE_INSIDER_FLOW_STRATEGY=True` in a controlled deployment and monitor via the existing dashboard + factor-tilt alert (Phase 54).

### Out of Scope for Phase 57 (explicitly)
- Options strategies of any kind (Master Spec §4.2)
- "Ladder-in on drawdown" averaging-down rules (Master Spec §9)
- Replacing or deprecating any existing signal strategy
- Copy-trading a single politician's portfolio wholesale (the signal is *one input* among many, not a standalone trading bot)

---

## **ALL PRIOR PLANNED PHASES COMPLETE**

APIS system build through Phase 56 is finished. 3626 → 3650 tests passing (100 skipped; +24 from Phase 57 scaffold). 35 scheduled jobs. 5 signal strategies wired + 1 new family scaffolded (InsiderFlowStrategy, not yet wired into SignalEngineService).

The only remaining work is **operational**:
- **CRITICAL MONITOR (2026-04-01 06:30 ET):** Check worker logs — `signal_generation_job_complete` should show `"signals": >0` for the first time now that the `securities` table is populated. If still 0, investigate `FeatureStoreService.compute_and_persist()` and whether market data bars exist in the DB.
- **CRITICAL MONITOR (2026-04-01 09:35 ET):** First paper trading cycle should NOT return `skipped_no_rankings`. Cycle count should finally start incrementing.
- **Investigate if needed:** If signals are still 0 despite securities being seeded, the next bottleneck is likely market data — `run_market_data_ingestion` at 06:00 ET needs to have populated OHLCV bars in the `daily_bars` table for `FeatureStoreService` to compute features.
- **Investigate Alpaca broker auth** — API keys may need refresh or re-generation (separate from signal generation issue)
- Set up live broker credentials (Interactive Brokers or equivalent)
- Toggle to live mode via `POST /api/v1/live-gate/promote` then set `APIS_OPERATING_MODE=human_approved` and restart
- Monitor via dashboard at `GET /dashboard` — Infrastructure Health panel shows component status
- **Note:** When running `docker compose` from `apis/infra/docker/`, always pass `--env-file "../../.env"` to avoid Grafana password interpolation error

## Phase 56 — COMPLETE

## Phase 55 — COMPLETE
- **Fill Quality Alpha-Decay Attribution** — `compute_alpha_decay()` + `compute_attribution_summary()` in `FillQualityService`. `run_fill_quality_attribution` job at 18:32 ET. `GET /portfolio/fill-quality/attribution`. Dashboard addendum. 2 new app_state fields. 44 tests → 3566 total passing. **30 scheduled jobs total.**

## Phase 54 — COMPLETE
- **Factor Tilt Alerts** — `FactorTiltAlertService` (stateless), `FactorTiltEvent` dataclass. Two triggers: dominant-factor name change, weight-shift >= 0.15 since last event. Wired into paper trading cycle after Phase 50 factor exposure block. Webhook alert via `alert_service`. GET /portfolio/factor-tilt-history (200 + empty list on no data). Dashboard section. 2 new app_state fields: `last_dominant_factor`, `factor_tilt_events`. 42 tests → 3522 total passing. 29 scheduled jobs total.

## Phase 56 — Next (Readiness Report History, ~55 tests)
- `ReadinessSnapshot` ORM + migration.
- Extend `ReadinessReportService` with `persist_snapshot` fire-and-forget DB write.
- GET /system/readiness-report/history (list, limit param).
- Dashboard trend table (last 10 snapshots, color-coded).
- No new job (stays 30 total).
- ~55 tests.
